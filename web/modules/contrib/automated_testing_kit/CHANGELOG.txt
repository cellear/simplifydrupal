Automated Testing Kit 1.3.0, 2024-11-23
---------------------------------------------
atk_drupal_recipe requires ATK 1.3.0, which is tied to 10.4.

Changes since 1.2.0 in tests:
- Updated tests to work with Drupal 10.4; they will no longer work on 10.3.
- Updated media image test to work with .webp images that Drupal now
  creates by default.
- Added new menu test (ATK-XX-1150).
- Added new search tests (ATK-XX-1160 through ATK-XX-1163).
- New helper functions:
  deleteCurrentNodeViaUi()
  deleteNodeWithNid()
  expectMessage()
  createRandomUser()
  inputTextIntoCKEditor()
  readYAML()
- Perform cleanup after some tests.
- Added menu URLs to xx.atk.config.js files.
- Removed all uses of Ethereal.email because Ethereal discontinued the free service.

Changes since 1.2.0 in the Drupal module:
- Added Automated Testing Kit Demo sub-module that runs cron when it is installed. This
  is required by the performant-labs/atk_drupal_recipe.
- Added new ability to atk_setup.sh script to copy tests back to their
  location inside modules/contrib/automated_testing_kit (useful for developers).
- atk_setup.sh now copies playwright.package.json or cypress.package.json
  to <project root>/package.json.
- Removed the ghost configuration form.
- Converted JSON data file to YML.
- It's now possible to change the installation destination of atk_setup (which is
  used in atk_drupal_recipe); see atk_setup for usage details.
